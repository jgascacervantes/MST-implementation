# MST-implementation

implementation of Kruskal's MST algorithm using union-find.
 * nodes will be represented as integers, edges as a source
 * and a destination node. MST will be a graph that adds to its
 * edge vector according to the algorithm.
 
 to test the program I built the example graph in the .png. Nodes are numbered from 0 to 7
 from the top "level" down, left to right.
